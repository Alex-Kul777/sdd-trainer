# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root.
- **`DECISIONS.md`** at the repo root: architecture decisions as `ADR-NNN` sections in a single file (ADR-001..008 so far). Read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. New ADRs are appended to the same file.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md      ← domain glossary (renamed from CONTEXT.md on 2026-11-01)
├── DECISIONS.md     ← single-file ADR home (ADR-001..008)
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-005 (GigaChat via OpenAI-compatible API), but worth reopening because…_
